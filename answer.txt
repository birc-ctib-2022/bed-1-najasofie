How does your method for extracting features work?
Answer: First we test if the bed-file contain any of the wanted chromosomes
from the query-files. then we tjek if the start position from the bed-file,
is between the start- and end position (>end position) given in the query-file.
The program prints the lines from the bed-file, that meets the requirements. 

What is the complexity of the algorithm, as a function of the size of the two input files? 
When you answer this, you need to know that you can get the list of chromosomse from a `query.Table`
in constant time, but it does, of course, take longer to run through all the lines in it.
Anwer: We interate over all the rows in bed-file (n) as many times as the amount of rows in the query-file (m).
Therefor we get O(n*m)

Did you, at any point, exploit that our features are on single nucleotides and not larger regions?
Answer: We have assumed that all the end positions are start position + 1.

If you did, what would it take to handle general regions?
Answer: we did not make a general algorithm and therefor have not considered what it takes 
to make an algorithm that handles a general case.
